# Course Work Repo - 4th Semester

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th semester, covering three essential courses: Database Management System (DBMS), Information Security (IS), and Operating System (OS).

## Courses and Projects

### 1.Database Management System (DBMS) 
   - Implemented a high-performance B+ tree for the dictionary, handling extensive test cases (approx. 1 lakh).
    

### 2.Information Security (IS)
   - Encryption Algorithms: Implemented AES with single and multiple keys for robust data encryption.
   - Classic Ciphers: Developed code for monoalphabetic cipher and polyalphabetic cipher.
   - Polyalphabetic Cipher with Key: Implemented a stronger version of the polyalphabetic cipher with user-defined keys.
   - SHA-512 Code: Implemented SHA-512 hashing algorithm for secure data hashing.
   

### 3.Operating System (OS)
   - Process Synchronization: Code for ensuring process synchronization and avoiding conflicts.
   - Banker's Algorithm: Implemented the Banker's algorithm for safe resource allocation.
   - Dining Philosophers: Developed code to solve the classic dining philosophers problem.
   - CPU Scheduling: Implemented various CPU scheduling algorithms to optimize process execution.
   - Reader-Writer Problem: Code for handling the reader-writer problem efficiently.
   - Semaphore: Implemented semaphore mechanisms for process synchronization.
   - Peterson Code: Developed Peterson's algorithm for mutual exclusion.
   - Multithreading Chat System: Created a chat system using multithreading for concurrent messaging.
